# README

- `cb_fam_Y_tsne2d_lamest.csv` contains the expression levels of the transformed
  CB data for every column (i.e. not preprocessed), the point estimates for 
  lambda (the subpopulation id from the feature allocation model), and the
  two-dimensional embeddings of the **preprocessed** data.
- `reference_implementation` contains reference code that can be used as a
  **template** to replicate the TSNE figure in the paper.
